# useful_scripts

Some random useful scripts (mostly for macOS).

1. Enable repeat keys only for certain applications
2. Allow windows to be dragged from any point inside window (with Ctrl-Cmd + <drag>)
3. Speed up appearance and disappearance of Dock (if auto-hide is enabled)
4. Fix Bluetooth mouse polling/lag
